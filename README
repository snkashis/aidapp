This system uses a bank of sensors via Arduino to transmit signals to the web app which provides for an interactive First Aid CPR training experience.

Uses jQuery, PHP, MySQL, Processing, and JSON.
We installed Piezo , temperature, pressure, and microphone sensors in a training dummy to detect the range of different stimuli.

Also uses Florian Jenett's awesome SQLibrary plugin for Processing.

The basic flow of data is

Arduino >> Processing >> MySQL DB (via SQLibrary) >> jQuery Polling with AJAXed PHP >> Rendered view in Mobile Safari.

Binaries are in the application.* folders.

Application was run on MAMP with Leopard Internet Sharing. iPad was running iOS 3.2.

Part of our MA Interactive Media program at the London College of Communication.
