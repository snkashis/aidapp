This system uses a bank of sensors via Arduino to transmit signals to the web app which provides for an interactive First Aid CPR training experience.

Uses jQuery, PHP, MySQL, Processing, and JSON.
We installed Piezo , temperature, pressure, and microphone sensors in a CPR dummy to detect the range of different stimuli.

Also uses Florian Jenett's awesome SQLibrary plugin for Processing.
